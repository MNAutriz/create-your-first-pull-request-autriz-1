CMSC 100 - UV2L     

The expectations that I have for CMSC 100 is that it will allow me to equip with the righteous knowledge in web programming specifically frontend, backend, and 
fullstack development to obtain advancements in the field of computer science. Additionally, I anticipate that this course with foster my knowledge in HTML, CSS, 
Javascript and various programming proficiency towards progressive refinement.

I agree with your expectations and I am also expecting the same for this course. I hope we'd still both have our sanity intact after finishing this course. Cheers
